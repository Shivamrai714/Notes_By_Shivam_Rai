1. Make Django Application , install django universally from the powershell 
2. => pip install django 
3.Create the project using django-admin
   => django-admin startproject todoList
4.Now open the created project in VsCode. Drag drop the project . (Now optional : create the virtual environment for project and make new termial in active environtment. )
5.Now create the new app for the project ie home App .
 => python manage.py startapp home
6.now create the basics other folders like static , template etc  (Make sure to create project structure , by Opoening app in file explorer. )
7. Make necessary configuration inside the setting.py file of todoList project.
 -add the templates folder in TEMPLATE=[] , in 'DIRS'   - use BASE_DIR join to make it easy for django to find template folder inside the BASE_DIR(structre of full project )
    'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')],
 -add static files dir aslo in same way.
     STATICFILES_DIRS=[os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'static')]
 -also adding our current app  'home'  inside the INSTALLED_APP=[] 

8.Now check your project is running fine by command
 => python manage.py runserver
9.Now we go to follow the MVT ( Model View Template ) structure . ( Here model are basically python classes that communicate with database and represent the structures , views  are used to communicate between model and templates and deliver response to clients , templates are structures to show pages. )
10.Now just open the url.py file of project and copy it to our home app.
11.Then define the url in project app to show the views of specific App. Also define the end points method in views.
   -In urls.py file of Project , we are going to include the home.url  app
   -Then in urls.py file of Home app , we are going to render the views , so just add path to show specific views from eg  path('', views.home , name='home') , 
   -Also make sure to define the method in the views file eg 
            def home(request):
  		  return  HttpResponse('Home view')
   -Now some sort of warrning are going to come ie to migrate the changes. Makemigrations  means to create the SQL equilvalent code  , and to  python manage.py migrate .. helps to create the tables in the database from the sql equilatent code from the model classes defined.
   
12.Now do the concept of tempalte inheritance. Make a base.html containing  header, footer , navbar and  Django {% block content %} {% blockend %}  , also use this line whenever inheriting this base template in any file 

     {% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %}   ........  {% end content %}

13. Now simply use the table to show all the list of the todo list.So make the    and use the bootstrap table to show them .
  -Make another file taskList.html  and  put bootstrap table code there.  
  -Now just extend / inherit the base template and then  do the configuration accordingly.
  -Define the method  def of task in views of home App .
  -In home.url file , then  just make the path('tasks' , taskList.html , name='taskList')

14. Now we are going to make  Model to save the data of form to be saved in sqllite database.

    -Install the Django extension of VsCode in virtual environment. (Enable it for auto import )
    -Now crate the model in model.py file of Home app.

    -now also save this App in INSTALLED APPS list (if now done till now , otherwise the migration will not work .)

15. Now go to the admin.py file to register the model App

16. Stop currrent project .  Now open another terminal by + and create the super userr to access the django database and see the required tables .

   python manage.py createsuperuser  (It give error , as we have not makemigrations (SQL equivalent codee ) )
    
==> python manage.py makemigrations   (will create SQL equivalent code using Models )
==> python manage.py migrate          (will create table in  DB using previous created code )

Now create the super user and give password, name etc 

==> python manage.py createsuperuser

  Rerun the project again. 
   ==> python manage.py runserver
 
And now open  ie http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin   to see the database of Django and login with created id, and password

-def _str__(self):  method is used to chage appearnce of Task in database

17. Now add the action and post in the Add task forrm
 -Now When we click the Submit button csrf errorr will come , just add the csrf_token inside the form tag
 -Now handle the post request in the home method in views file.
    if post request , then handle the forrm submit.
    if get request come, just show the Form to add Task

-We are using the context dictionary object to show the Alert of form submission to user , using conditional statements 

--- Stopped on Alert message video Tut : 16
I have created a mistake in the making the table / model  , so just delete the db.sqlite3 file and also internal file of migratation folder. 
Now open the terminal and then just  done 
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

Now go to    127.0.0.1/admin  to view the database . (Make sure u have created python  manage.py createsuperuser )


18. using the if statements , we have rendered the alert box dyanmically after the form submission.
-Also {% comments %} {% endcomments %} are not visisble on view page source , but <!-- html comment are visisble -->

-Learn more about it : google Django Tags and filters.


19. Showing the all todo in the list . And showing them in tasks page.
